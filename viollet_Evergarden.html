        Violet Evergarden (ヴァイオレット・エヴァーガーデン, Vaioretto Evāgāden?) is the protagonist of the Violet Evergarden series. 
        Violet is a former soldier who was enlisted in the Leidenschaftlich army and fought in the war, where she was treated as nothing more than a weapon. 
        Violet became an Auto Memories Doll at the CH Postal Company after the war, seeking to understand the meaning of the words "I love you," which was said to her by
         her major Gilbert Bougainvillea, during the War's final battle.
