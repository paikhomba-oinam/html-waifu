    YoRHa No. 2 Type B, commonly referred to as 2B, is one of the three lead protagonists of Nier: Automata.
    She is presented as a "B" (Battler) combat android for YoRHa, a newly-created squadron dedicated to reclaiming Earth from invading aliens and allowing humanity to return. 
    The aliens created a vast robotic army - the Machines - as part of a prolonged proxy war. 
    While classified as a "B" model, she is really a disguised "E" (Executioner) model, who is aware of the truth about YoRHa - that humanity had gone extinct long ago, following the events of Nier. 
    Her orders are to kill the scanner android 9S, deleting his memories, whenever he learns too much. Consequently, 2B is burdened by grief and guilt about her role, and tries to keep him at an emotional distance.

<p>
    Moreover she has a beautiful appearance and personality, which she develops gradually after fighting side-by-side with 9S.
    She starts to question her existence after she starts to see consiousness in machine lifeforms which was supposed to be their sworn enemies.
