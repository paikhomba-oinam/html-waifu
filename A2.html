        YoRHa Type A No.2, or just A2, is one of the protagonists of NieR:Automata, as well as the final boss in Branch D. 
        She is also a major character in the YoRHa Stage Play.
        She is a prototype of the YoRHa android line, and combat data from her and her comrades were used to create the superior current lines, including 2B and 9S. 
        She doesn't like to speak and often keeps to herself.
